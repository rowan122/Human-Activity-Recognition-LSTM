# Human Activity Recognition using LSTM

This project applies a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to recognize human activities from time-series sensor data. Itâ€™s a deep learning approach to classify activities like walking, sitting, and standing based on accelerometer and gyroscope signals.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset contains recordings of 30 participants performing daily activities while wearing a smartphone on the waist.

## ðŸ§  Model
We built an LSTM-based neural network using TensorFlow/Keras. The model takes sequential input data and learns to classify the type of human activity.

### Model Architecture:
- Input: Time-series sensor features
- LSTM layers
- Dense layers
- Output: Activity class (6 classes)

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
The model achieved good accuracy on the test set and was able to successfully distinguish between different human activities.
